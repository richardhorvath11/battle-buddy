"""The dev-only reference encoding of the catalog conventions documented in
``skills/catalog/`` (the annotation mapping, entity classification, the
degradation posture) and of ``tests/fixtures/catalog/README.md``'s format
decision (research R2 — ``catalog-info.yaml`` written in strict JSON syntax,
parsed with stdlib ``json``, never a YAML library).

This module IS: the CI instrument that lets those documented rules be
*exercised* by hermetic tests (Constitution VIII) instead of merely asserted
on prose. Nothing here ships (Constitution I; FR-009) — the catalog skill
explicitly does not ship a parsing library or catalog-adapter code; at
runtime the "parser" is an agent reading ``catalog-info.yaml`` files through
the code capability, guided by the skill's prose, not this module.

This module is NOT: proof that a live agent actually follows that prose when
it reads a real catalog repo. That is design §10's scenario-harness
territory — a live-agent exercise, never a hermetic unit/contract test. This
module only pins what "correct" looks like for the fixtures a hermetic test
can run against; it says nothing about agent behavior.

House style mirrors ``tests/helpers/doctor_flows.py``: plain functions over
plain dicts (no classes, no dataclasses), each step's comment citing the
prose section it encodes.

    service missing only ``dashboards`` still briefs normally in every other
    respect, gaining exactly one disabled feature (``pane_driving``) and no
    more. A fully-annotated service — every field non-empty — returns an
    empty set.

    ``missing_owner`` is deliberately NOT a key in ``DEGRADED_FEATURES_BY_FIELD``,

    ``parse_entity``'s own ``missing_owner`` warning), not a disabled
    feature, because ownership disables no feature. Do not "fix" this
    function by adding it.

    A malformed ``catalog-info.yaml`` disables nothing globally: it
    contributes a ``Failure`` at ``load_catalog`` time and the service it
    would have defined is simply absent from ``catalog["services"]`` —
    every other file still parses, and every other service still briefs
    normally. This function only ever looks at one already-parsed
    ``service`` at a time; it has no notion of "globally" to begin with.

    Defensive about shape: a ``service`` that is not a ``dict`` (or is
    missing a field entirely) is treated as if every field on it were
    empty — never raises. Mirrors ``_as_dict``'s contract elsewhere in this
    module, which is why a fully-missing/``None`` service disables all four
    features rather than raising.

    option, not a promise this surface makes today — unbounded traversal
    would invite cycle-handling machinery a tier-0-scale catalog doesn't

    written; it was already surfaced as a ``dangling_dependency`` warning at
    ``load_catalog`` time. On a messy catalog, a dependency on an
    uncatalogued service is the normal case, not an error to hide — silently
    shrinking a blast radius is worse than a wide one with a note attached.

    A ``name`` absent from the catalog, or present with an empty/missing
